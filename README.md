A command system written in JavaScript, based on [kimiko](https://github.com/AperLambda/kimiko/). It has the advantage to be very flexible.

It handles command usage, description, aliases and sub command propagation.

The command names are encoded as Identifiers: they are of the form `namespace:path`. This allows for several commands of different sources to have the same name.

## Installation & Usage

You can install this library from `npm`:

```sh
npm i kimiko
```

Once it has been installed, you just need to require it in you code:

```js
import * as kimiko from "kimiko";
```

All of the classes will be contained in `kimiko`. All you then have to do is to implement it.
